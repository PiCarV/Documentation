\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Introduction}
In our last lab, you were shown how to use droppout layers in your neural network. In combining droppout layers along with your previous knowlage of convolution layers and dense layers, hopefully you have been successfull in creating a neural network that can accuratly and quickly follow lanes.
\\ \\
During this lab's time, your goal is to optimize your neural network as best you can. We recomend that you try your best to optimize your network to the grading parameters that will be disscused in this lab manual.
\\ \\
This lab will only be disscussing the measures and parameters that will be used to grade your model. The intention for this lab is that it will give you a clear outline of what is expected from your neural network.

\chapter{Big Three}
The "Big Three" things that your models will be graded on are as follows:
\\
\indent Accuracy, Speed, and Size (A.S.S.).
\\ \\
Your models will be run through a script which will record your MSE values and the size of your model.

\section{Accuracy}
Accuracy will be dertermined through 

\section{Size}
The Size of your model refers to the amount of bits that your model is made of. For an example, the size of a neural network may be 1.3 Gigabytes or it could also be something like 342 Megabytes.
This metric will be measured at the same time as your accuracy.

\section{Speed}
The speed of your models is going to be the most challenging portion of your grade. This metric will be gathered as the time it takes your car to complete a preset track. Remember that you can controll the speed of your car while it is self driving but you can only go as fast as your neural network can think.
